Using struct vectors and storing them inside of files might be a bit too complicated. Maybe try another solution. Solution are ranked by superiority:
1. Try using arrays,
2. Use the solution they have provided.


You can create a new file at each new update of the file, or you can just keep adding to the old file. It's up to you.

infile.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(this), sizeof(*this)) - this might be the key line to help you out.

TASK FOR NOW:
Try to store arrays or vectors inside of files.
